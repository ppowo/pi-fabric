You keep talking to Pi the way you always do. Fabric gives the model **one programmable tool** — `fabric_exec` — that it uses to compose Pi's core tools, MCP servers, captured extension tools, child agents, persistent actors, and durable coordination into a single type-checked TypeScript program. The program runs in a QuickJS sandbox; only the final result comes back to the conversation. Branching, loops, fan-out, and data flow become code the model writes and type-checks — not a stack of separate tool calls you have to orchestrate.

## Why Fabric?

|     | Capability | What it unlocks |
| :-: | ---------- | --------------- |
| ⚡ | **Code mode** | One flat tool schema; branching, loops, fan-out, and data flow live in checked TypeScript. |
| 🧰 | **Capability routing** | Call Pi core tools, MCP servers, captured extension tools, or Fabric providers through one runtime. |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 | **Agent runtime** | One-shot workers, persistent event-driven actors, councils, and bounded recursive queries. |
| 🕸️ | **Workflows + mesh** | Phased progress plus durable topics, shared tasks, and compare-and-swap state. |
| 🛡️ | **Guardrails** | Approvals, isolation, timeouts, concurrency, recursion depth, and shared cost budgets. |
| 🎛️ | **Native TUI** | Live activity, an interactive dashboard, and settings without leaving Pi. |

## How it works

1. **You ask** in plain language, as usual.
2. **Pi writes one program** that calls the tools, agents, and MCP servers it needs. The program is type-checked before it runs.
3. **Only the result returns** to your conversation. Intermediate work stays in the sandbox and surfaces in the activity panel and dashboard.

Under the hood, the model writes something like this — you don't:

```ts
const [manifest, sources] = await Promise.all([
  pi.read({ path: "package.json" }),
  pi.find({ pattern: "**/*.ts", path: "src" }),
]);
return {
  package: JSON.parse(manifest).name,
  sourceCount: sources.split("\n").filter(Boolean).length,
};
```

Independent calls run in parallel; only the returned object enters the model context.

## Install

Requires Node.js 24+ and Pi 0.80.6+.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-fabric
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

From GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/monotykamary/pi-fabric
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-fabric
```

For one development run:

```bash
pi -e /absolute/path/to/pi-fabric
```

</details>

## What you can ask for

Every pattern below is a skill Pi loads on demand. Invoke it with `/skill:<name>`, or just describe the task and let Pi pick it up.

| You want | Ask for | Skill |
| -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Parallel audits, migrations, or research with phased progress and a final synthesis | “Audit every auth file in parallel and synthesize findings.” | `/skill:fabric-workflow` |
| Work too big for one context window, decomposed recursively | “Produce a compact architecture map of this repo.” | `/skill:fabric-rlm` |
| A persistent watcher that steers only when you drift | “Watch this migration until it's complete and tested.” | `/skill:fabric-supervisor` |
| A quiet decision-point reviewer | “Review my decisions at idle and tool-error points.” | `/skill:fabric-advisor` |
| Several reviewers reconciled into one verdict | “Run correctness, security, and test reviewers, then merge.” | `/skill:fabric-council` |
| Multi-model deliberation with a compare-not-merge judge | “Deliberate this design across models.” | `/skill:fabric-fusion` |
| A durable team coordinating through shared tasks | “Stand up a team that claims tasks atomically and reports progress.” | `/skill:fabric-swarm` |
| Edits gated behind typed evidence and postconditions | “Make this parser change only if focused tests stay green.” | `/skill:fabric-schema` |

The foundation is the `fabric-exec` reference skill: the model loads it before its first `fabric_exec` call and again when a call errors on argument shape.

## The dashboard

Fabric adds a live activity surface to Pi, no extra extension required:

- A compact widget above the chat (like `pi-supervisor`) whose header follows the current phase while its rows list only active or completed `agents` provider workers.
- `/fabric dashboard` — a phase sidebar, per-agent detail with live transcripts, and controls to steer, queue follow-ups, or stop runs.
- `/fabric settings` — mirrors Pi's `/settings` and writes changes to `fabric.json`.

See the [interface & commands reference](docs/interface.md) for every view, keybinding, and slash command.

- [Interface & commands](docs/interface.md) — dashboard, settings, keybindings, slash commands, and headless runs.
- [Agents, actors & mesh](docs/agents.md) — subagents, the Claude runner, transports, steering, persistent actors, global templates, councils, recursive queries, and durable coordination.
- [External providers](docs/providers.md) — the versioned provider protocol for extensions.
- [Architecture & security](docs/architecture.md) — the host bridge, sandboxing, tool-call robustness, and limitations.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The test suite covers configuration, schema validation, provider dispatch, registered-tool interception and execution, QuickJS isolation, Pi built-in invocation, subagents, fake Claude stream-JSON and model discovery, workflows, durable mesh state, actor mailboxes and subscriptions, and Pi/Claude actor restoration. Claude fixtures never make a billable request.
