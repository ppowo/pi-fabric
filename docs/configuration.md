# Configuration

Pi Fabric reads configuration from two JSON files. Project values override global values.

1. `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json` — global defaults.
2. `<project>/.pi/fabric.json` — project overrides, only for **trusted** projects.

`/fabric settings` writes changes to the same files: trusted projects write to `<project>/.pi/fabric.json`; untrusted sessions write to the global `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json`.

## Code modes

With the default full code mode, `fabric_exec` exclusively owns Pi core tool execution. The parent model sees one programmable tool instead of direct `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` schemas. Fabric programs use those capabilities through `pi.*`:

```ts
const files = await pi.find({ pattern: "**/*.ts", path: "src" });
const matches = await pi.grep({ pattern: "TODO", path: "src" });
return { files, matches };
```

Independent calls should be parallel:

```ts
const [packageJson, readme] = await Promise.all([
  pi.read({ path: "package.json" }),
  pi.read({ path: "README.md" }),
]);
return {
  package: JSON.parse(packageJson).name,
  readmeLines: readme.split("\n").length,
};
```

### Full code mode (default)

`fullCodeMode: true` is the default. Fabric removes active Pi core tools from the parent model and exposes their implementations only inside `fabric_exec` through `pi.*`. Registered overrides such as security gates and code previews are captured too, so `pi.read()` continues to route through the override rather than bypassing it.

Fabric remembers which native core tools were active before taking ownership. Switching to orchestration-only mode or unloading Fabric restores that selection. Full-mode ownership is reasserted before user input and agent startup, so tools manually re-enabled during the session do not leak back into the parent schema.

### Orchestration-only mode

Users who want Fabric for MCP, agents, ambient actors, parallel workflows, councils, and recursive delegation — but want Pi's core tools to remain entirely native — can opt out of full code mode:

```json
{
  "fullCodeMode": false
}
```

In orchestration-only mode:

- Pi's `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` tools stay on Pi's normal model-facing and execution paths.
- Registered extension tools also remain in Pi's native registry; Fabric does not hide, wrap, or expose them through `extensions.*`.
- `pi.*`, `extensions.*`, and equivalent `tools.call()` references are unavailable inside `fabric_exec`, including when TypeScript checks are bypassed.
- MCP providers, one-shot and recursive agents, persistent ambient actors, dynamic workflows, mesh coordination, councils, explicit Fabric providers, and the Fabric TUI remain available.
- Child agents continue using their allowed Pi tools directly, so parallel and ambient setups do not route their coding operations back through Fabric code mode.

### Where to set it

`fullCodeMode` defaults to `true`. A project can set the flag in `.pi/fabric.json`, or a user can set it globally in `~/.pi/agent/fabric.json`. `/fabric settings` toggles it too.

## Captured extension tools

When `fullCodeMode` is enabled, Fabric intercepts Pi's `ExtensionRunner.getAllRegisteredTools()` registry chokepoint. This captures tools registered by other extensions at startup or later through `pi.registerTool()`, regardless of whether those extensions load before or after Fabric.

Captured custom tools are removed from Pi's model-facing registry by default, so their schemas, snippets, and guidelines do not consume the parent model context. The extension itself remains loaded: its commands, event handlers, state, and UI continue to work. Only tool discovery and invocation become lazy.

```ts
const matches = await tools.search({ query: "deployment status" });
const schema = await tools.describe({ ref: matches[0].ref });
const result = await tools.call({
  ref: schema.ref,
  args: { environment: "staging" },
});
return result;
```

For tool names valid as JavaScript properties, use the shorter proxy:

```ts
const result = await extensions.project_status({ verbose: true });
return result.text;
```

The result preserves `content`, text content as `text`, `details`, `isError`, `terminate`, and source provenance. Fabric runs the captured definition's `prepareArguments()` and original executor with its owning extension context. Pi's `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `tool_execution_*` lifecycle handlers are also applied to nested captured calls.

Extension overrides of core tools are captured and hidden with their built-in counterparts in full code mode. Inside Fabric, `pi.read`, `pi.bash`, and the other built-ins automatically route through a captured override when one exists; `extensions.read` exposes the override's full native result shape. `capture.keepVisible` can retain non-core extension tools in Pi's direct registry, but core tool names are always excluded while full code mode owns them.

## Approvals and risk

Fabric risk classes are `read`, `write`, `execute`, `network`, and `agent`; approval policy values are `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`.

- Captured tools default to the conservative `execute` risk because Pi tool definitions do not declare effects. Add exact tool-name overrides under `capture.risks`.
- Set `capture.hideFromModel` to `false` to index non-core extension tools without hiding them.
- `capture.keepVisible` names stay in both Fabric and Pi's direct registry, except that Pi core names are always Fabric-owned in full code mode.
- An `ask` policy is fail-closed in headless modes without interactive UI.
- Approval is cached by risk class for one `fabric_exec` execution.

## Subagents

`subagents.runner` selects the default harness (`"pi"` or `"claude"`). `subagents.model` is the optional Pi `provider/id` override; `subagents.claude.model` is the optional canonical Claude runtime key. `subagents.claude.binary` defaults to `claude` and can be an absolute path or wrapper; `PI_FABRIC_CLAUDE_BINARY` overrides it for the current process. `/fabric settings` enumerates Claude models from that binary and stores the two runner defaults independently.

Other subagent settings:

- `thinking` — default reasoning effort (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`), default `medium`.
- `maxConcurrent` — global child concurrency semaphore.
- `maxPerExecution` — hard cap on children per `fabric_exec` invocation.
- `maxDepth` — recursion depth bound for `rlm.query()`.
- `timeoutMs` — per-child wall-clock budget.
- `extensions` — whether Claude children keep their normal Claude Code customizations.
- `defaultTools` — the default tool allowlist for children.
- `budgetUsd` — shared append-only cost ledger across a recursion tree (0 disables).
- `maxTokensPerChild` — per-child cumulative token bound (0 disables).
- `notifyOnComplete` — send a follow-up completion message for a detached `agents.spawn()`.

See [agents, actors & mesh](agents.md) for the runner and transport details.

## MCP

- `mcp.disableOAuth` — when true, MCP calls may use cached credentials but cannot launch a new interactive OAuth flow.
- `mcp.callTimeoutMs` — per-call timeout bound.
- `mcp.allowDynamicServers` — permit `mcp.register()` of ephemeral servers.
- `mcp.enabled` — set to `false` to disable the MCP surface.

See the [`mcp` reference](../skills/fabric-exec/references/mcp.md) for the call surface.

## UI

- `ui.widget` is `auto`, `always`, or `hidden`. `auto` shows active or retained Fabric runs and agent-provider activity; persistent actors can keep the summary header visible but do not occupy widget rows.
- The widget renders above the chat (like `pi-supervisor`); set `ui.enabled` to `false` to disable both the widget and dashboard controller.

See the [interface reference](interface.md).

## Mesh

Mesh data defaults to `<project>/.pi/fabric/mesh`. Set `mesh.root` to a relative or absolute path to relocate durable topics, shared state, and actor sessions. Add `.pi/fabric/mesh/` to the project's ignore file unless the coordination log is intentionally versioned. Set `mesh.enabled` to `false` to disable both mesh actions and ambient actor restoration.

`mesh.actorScope` controls where persistent actor definitions, mailboxes, and child sessions are stored and restored from:

- `"project"` (default) keeps a single shared actor registry at `.pi/fabric/mesh/actors/`, so actors survive `/new` and carry over between Pi sessions in the same project without redefinition. One Pi process should own the actor registry at a time — concurrent sessions sharing a registry may race on writes.
- `"session"` isolates actors per Pi session (under `.pi/fabric/mesh/actors/<sessionId>/`). Use this when you run concurrent Pi sessions in one project and want each to own its own actors.

With project scope, one Pi process should own the actor registry at a time — concurrent sessions sharing a registry may race on writes. Mesh topics and shared state are always project-scoped.

## Compaction

The deterministic, LLM-free compaction engine is default-on. Set `compaction.engine` to `"pi"` to restore pi-core compaction. When pi-vcc is also installed, Fabric takes precedence for automatic compaction, while an explicit `/pi-vcc` command always uses pi-vcc's engine. See [compaction](compaction.md) for invariants, sections, and limits.
