# State layer (fabric-schema)

The `state` provider is a typed, labeled world-model layer over mesh storage. It records claims, attached executable evidence, verification outcomes, and compare-and-swap state transitions. By itself it provides durable process state and fail-closed reporting; in the default `schema.mode: "off"` it is not a gate on direct Pi tools such as `pi.edit` or `pi.bash`.

The separate opt-in Schema transaction layer adds `audit` and `enforce` modes. In enforce mode, state reads remain available but `state.transition`, `state.verify`, `state.goal`, and `state.checkGoal` are blocked from model-originated calls; mutations use the host-owned `schema.*` transaction control plane instead. See [Schema enforcement](./schema-enforcement.md).

## Claim, evidence attachment, and certification

These are separate states:

1. A **claim** is the transition `summary` and its labeled move from one world-model state to another.
2. **Evidence attachment** stores shell commands on the transition. Attachment means only that the commands can be replayed; it does not mean they ran or passed.
3. **Certification** occurs only when `state.verify` selects at least one transition, runs at least one evidence command, and every result is `confirmed` (exit 0). A successful verification emits a `state.certified` event. When that verification targets the current head, its latest certificate is also CAS-persisted in `state/current` so current certification survives event-window truncation.

Verification fails closed. A missing current or requested target, empty evidence, non-zero exit, spawn error, timeout, cancellation, or certification-publish failure returns `certified: false` and `violated: true`, and attempts to emit `state.violated` with every blocking reason. Violation reporting is best effort: if mesh publication also fails, the report is still returned and includes `reportingError`. In that exceptional case no durable failure event exists, so an earlier durable certificate cannot be revoked in storage; callers must treat the returned report as authoritative. `violated` is preserved for compatibility; callers should make the positive check `if (!verification.certified)`. A successful result is durable only after `state.certified` is published.

Evidence commands are arbitrary shell commands and are legacy trusted workflow input. They execute with the invoking process's authority. The state layer executes the command exactly as shell input and does not parse, classify, or infer meaning from its prose or output. Tests, type checks, and greps can be strong, useful evidence for a scoped claim, but passing tests are evidence rather than proof.

## Schema-inspired mapping

| Concept | Pi Fabric implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Editable labeled world state | Mesh key `state/current`, advanced with compare-and-swap. |
| Append-only timeline | Mesh topic `fabric.state`; transition and verification events remain inspectable. |
| Replayable evidence | `state.verify` executes commands attached to selected transitions. |
| Certification | A fail-closed verification report plus durable `state.certified` event and digests. |
| Surprise | `state.violated` records non-confirmed results and blocking reasons. |
| Representation revision | A `kind: "representation"` transition establishes the active history boundary. |
| Complexity reduction | Decision-point reduction requires attached evidence and remains pending until later verification succeeds. |
| Executable goal | `state.goal({ check })` stores a predicate; `state.checkGoal()` executes it. |

The `fabric-schema` skill uses these facilities as workflow discipline when Schema mode is off, and uses the `schema.*` transaction API when audit or enforce mode is selected. The state provider alone does not prevent bypass; the central ActionRegistry gate is what supplies enforce-mode authorization.

## Storage format

Storage is mesh-native. Raw mesh reads can inspect all state-layer records.

### Topic `fabric.state`

The append-only JSONL event log contains:

- **`transition`** — a versioned proposal: `data: { protocolVersion: 1, phase: "proposed", label, from?, to, summary, evidence?, tags?, kind?, complexity?, certificationStatus?, ts }`.
- **`transition.committed`** — makes its referenced proposal visible after all ledger and head CAS writes succeed.
- **`transition.rejected`** — records a failed proposal and its rollback/quarantine status. A proposal is never visible merely because this marker exists.
- **`state.certified`** — emitted only after successful verification. Its data contains bounded `targets`, the verification-time `head`, `evidenceDigest`, `resultDigest`, `certificationStatus: "certified"`, and `ts`.
- **`state.violated`** — best-effort reporting for failed-closed verification. Its data contains bounded non-confirmed `results`, blocking `reasons`, selected `targets`, the verification-time `head`, and both digests.
- **`state.goal.met`** — emitted when the executable goal predicate passes.

A certificate target includes the transition's stable `transitionId`, `label`, and `to`. When verification has a head, the certificate also records its `transitionId`, label, destination, and CAS `version`. Certification and violation events are folded in sequence for each target. A transition receives a certified overlay only when its latest durable verification outcome is `state.certified`; a later `state.violated` removes that overlay. Certificate currentness additionally requires the complete recorded head identity—transition ID, label, destination, and CAS version—to equal the committed current head.

For a successful verification of the current head, `state/current` is CAS-rewritten with the latest current certificate. The stored certificate binds to the version produced by that CAS, rather than the pre-write version, so persisting it does not make itself stale. If the CAS loses to head advancement, the event remains a certificate of its target but is returned with `current: false` and is not attached to the new head. A later failed verification targeting the same current head publishes `state.violated` and CAS-removes the durable certificate. A new transition replaces the whole head value and therefore drops the prior current certificate naturally.

Both digests use SHA-256 and a `sha256:<hex>` representation. `evidenceDigest` deterministically covers the full ordered target identities and attached commands. `resultDigest` deterministically covers the ordered statuses, full-output digests and byte counts, bounded prefixes, omitted-byte metadata, command/claim digests, and failures. The result digest therefore changes when any byte of command output or failure details changes even when the returned output prefix is truncated.

Inspect the raw values with:

```ts
const events = await mesh.read({ topic: "fabric.state" });
const head = await mesh.get({ key: "state/current" });
const goal = await mesh.get({ key: "state/goal" });
```

### Key `state/current`

The compare-and-swap head contains the transition identity and claim:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 2,
  "commitProof": { "version": 1, "status": "committed" },
  "transitionSequence": 42,
  "label": "applied-auth-patch",
  "from": "guard-planned",
  "to": "guard-applied",
  "summary": "Refresh-token rotation now holds the lock",
  "kind": "state",
  "transitionId": "<mesh event id>",
  "ts": 1700000000000,
  "evidence": ["grep -RIn 'lock' src/auth/refresh.ts"],
  "tags": ["auth"]
}
```

The mesh entry's `version` is exposed as `head.version`. New protocol-2 heads are first CAS-written with commit proof `{ version: 1, status: "pending" }` and the proposal's original mesh sequence. After `transition.committed` publishes, a second CAS changes the proof to `committed`. A structurally valid committed proof remains readable without the proposal or marker in the bounded mesh read window. Pending proof never becomes durable merely because events age out: it is accepted only while a matching commit marker is visible, and a retained rejection marker overrides that commit marker. Existing protocol-1 heads retain their event-marker validation behavior, while older unversioned legacy heads retain their compatibility behavior.

The head stores the complete current transition fields needed to reconstruct its timeline record: original `sequence`, `label`, `from`, `to`, `summary`, `evidence`, `tags`, `kind`, `ts`, complexity delta, and transition-level certification status when present. If the current transition event ages out, history synthesizes only this validated current record; it never reconstructs an arbitrary non-current record from state keys.

A complexity-reduction head initially stores `certificationStatus: "pending"`. `state.get` overlays a validated durable or retained-event certificate as `certified`. The durable certificate itself is stored in `state/current`; it is omitted from reads if its full head binding is stale or a newer retained violation supersedes it.

### Keys `state/complexity/<file>`

Each supported file declared in a transition has a CAS ledger entry:

```json
{
  "file": "src/auth/refresh.ts",
  "language": "typescript/javascript",
  "count": 4,
  "lastDelta": -2,
  "ts": 1700000000000
}
```

The entry is the latest recorded observation. The event log retains baselines and deltas.

### Key `state/goal`

```json
{ "check": "pnpm typecheck && pnpm test", "description": "green suite" }
```

## Actions

Actions are discovered through `tools.call({ ref: "state.<action>", args })`.

### `state.transition` — risk: `write`

`{ label, from?, to, summary, evidence?, tags?, kind?, complexity?: { files: string[] }, force? }`

The provider validates `from` against the current committed head's `to` when supplied, appends a versioned proposal, CAS-writes complexity ledgers, CAS-advances `state/current` as pending, appends its commit marker, and CAS-upgrades the head's durable proof to committed. `force: true` preserves the existing mismatch/contention override behavior. Reads, history, verification selection, and certificate targeting ignore proposed or rejected transitions. Legacy transition events with no `phase` remain committed for compatibility.

When `complexity.files` is present, project-relative TS/JS/TSX/JSX files are counted immediately. The first supported observation is a baseline; later observations compare with and update the ledger. Unsupported files are reported but do not enter the ledger.

A negative net delta is rejected unless at least one non-empty behavior-preservation command is attached. Acceptance means **evidence-attached and pending**, not certified. The transition event and returned head contain `certificationStatus: "pending"`. The write action does not execute evidence secretly. Only a later successful `state.verify` emits a certificate; `state.history` and `state.get` can then expose which reduction transition it covers.

`kind: "representation"` establishes the history archive boundary described below.

Returns `{ event, head }`.

### `state.get` — risk: `read`

Returns `{ head, goal, complexity, certification, recentLabels }`. `certification.current` is a certificate only when its recorded head identity still equals the current head. The current head and its certified overlay survive event truncation for protocol-2 committed heads. `certification.recent` includes the durable current certificate plus retained visible event certificates; non-current certification history remains bounded by mesh event retention.

### `state.history` — risk: `read`

`{ label?, limit?, includeArchived? }` folds transitions into the ordered label graph and returns `{ transitions, labels, certifications }`. Matching committed transitions expose a certificate only when it is their latest verification outcome and `certificationStatus: "certified"`; a committed reduction without a latest successful outcome remains `pending`. Proposals and rejected transitions never appear. If retention removes the committed current transition event, the fold adds only the record reconstructed from a validated protocol-2 current head. Older non-current transitions and certificates are not synthesized and remain bounded by mesh retention.

The fold finds the last representation transition and excludes earlier transitions and their certificates by default. `includeArchived: true` reveals the full append-only transition history and permits archived certificates to be shown. A `label` filter matches `label`, `from`, or `to` within the selected archive view.

### `state.complexity` — risk: `read`

`{ files? }` counts requested project-relative files and compares them with the ledger. Omit `files` to inspect all recorded files. The result includes supported-language counts, current and recorded deltas, unsupported entries, and `netDelta`.

### `state.verify` — risk: `execute`

`{ labels?, includeArchived?, timeoutMs? }` selects the current head when `labels` is omitted, or active transitions matching the supplied labels. Archived transitions are excluded unless `includeArchived: true`.

Commands run sequentially with a per-command timeout (default 30 seconds). Combined stdout/stderr is streamed rather than accumulated without limit. Each report retains at most a 32 KiB UTF-8 prefix per command and includes `outputBytes`, `outputOmittedBytes`, and a digest of the complete byte stream. Claims, commands, and errors are also byte-bounded in results and carry digests/omission metadata. Verification events use smaller bounded prefixes, bounded result/reason arrays, and target chunks so each payload stays comfortably below the default 256 KiB mesh limit. Each result includes `{ claim, command, status, exitCode, output, outputBytes, outputOmittedBytes, outputDigest, error? }`, where `status` is:

- `confirmed` for exit 0;
- `violated` for a non-zero exit;
- `error` for spawn failure, timeout, or cancellation.

The report adds `{ certified, violated, certificationStatus, evidenceDigest, resultDigest, failures, certificate? }`. `certified` is true if and only if one or more evidence commands ran and every result was confirmed. All other outcomes are blocking and publish `state.violated`. A successful run publishes `state.certified` and returns its certificate. If the selected targets include the unchanged current head, it then CAS-persists that certificate in `state/current` with a binding to the resulting head version. A failed run targeting the unchanged current head CAS-revokes any stored certificate after violation publication succeeds.

An explicitly empty `labels` array is an empty selection and fails closed. Requesting an archived, proposed, rejected, or otherwise uncommitted label without a visible committed match also fails closed as a missing active target.

On POSIX, each command shell is the leader of a detached process group; timeout or abort sends `SIGKILL` to that group and waits for the shell/stdio close before returning. This covers descendants that remain in that process group, but cannot cover a descendant that deliberately creates a different process group/session. On Windows, timeout/abort awaits a bounded `taskkill /T /F` attempt and falls back to direct child termination; Windows cleanup is explicitly best effort and does not claim that every independently detached descendant is gone.

### `state.goal` — risk: `write`

`{ check, description? }` stores the executable goal predicate at `state/goal`.

### `state.checkGoal` — risk: `execute`

`{ timeoutMs? }` runs the goal predicate and reports `{ passed, output, exitCode, error? }`. It uses the same 32 KiB command-output cap; a passing `state.goal.met` event stores a smaller bounded prefix plus full-stream digest and omission metadata. Goal checks are separate from state certification.

## Complexity rule

The built-in complexity implementation supports `.ts`, `.js`, `.tsx`, and `.jsx`. It lexes tokens without an AST dependency and counts statement decision keywords:

- `if`, including the `if` in `else if`;
- `case` and `default` in a switch body;
- `catch`, including optional catch binding;
- `for` and `while`.

Strings, template/JSX prose, regular-expression literals, and comments are skipped; `${...}` and JSX expression code are tokenized. Ternaries, `&&`, `||`, optional chaining, and nullish coalescing do not count. Unsupported languages return `supported: false`.

## Determinism and contention

The head is CAS-advanced with a bounded eight-attempt retry loop. Its initial value is pending, and a proposal is not history until its commit marker follows successful ledger and head writes. On ledger, head, or commit-marker failure, the layer CAS-restores each completed write from its captured before-value (or CAS-deletes a newly created value) and best-effort emits `transition.rejected`. Deleted-key versions are carried in rejection metadata so later CAS creation remains version-aware. After marker publication, the transaction is committed and must not be rolled back; the normal path performs one more CAS to make that fact independent of event retention. On CAS failure the layer re-reads and re-validates `from`:

- if the transition still chains from the new head, it retries with the new version;
- if the chain is broken, it raises a contention error naming the actual head.

`force: true` skips both the pre-append mismatch check and contention re-validation. If every restoration succeeds, the rejected proposal stays invisible and prior ledger/head values are restored. If restoration or rejected-marker publication fails, the thrown error explicitly reports rollback quarantine/reporting failure; the proposal still has no commit marker and is never folded into history or verification. Certification changes the head's mesh version only when persisting or revoking the current certificate; it does not alter transition sequence or archive ordering.

### Crash and retention limits

- A crash before `transition.committed` leaves a pending head that fails closed. A crash after the marker is durable but before the proof-upgrade CAS leaves a pending head that is accepted only while that marker remains in the bounded read window. If the marker ages out first, the head fails closed and later transitions are blocked until an operator repairs or removes the quarantined pending value. The normal non-crashing path upgrades the proof immediately.
- Protocol-2 committed heads, their one current transition record, and their latest successfully persisted current certificate are independent of `mesh.maxReadEvents`. Protocol-1 versioned heads still require retained commit evidence; unversioned legacy heads keep their historical compatibility behavior.
- Non-current transitions and certificates are event history and may age out. The state key is deliberately not an unbounded history mirror.
- Violation publication and certificate revocation are separate durable writes. If violation publication fails, revocation is not attempted and the returned failed report is authoritative. If publication succeeds but the revocation state write fails for a non-contention storage error, the report includes `reportingError`; the retained violation suppresses the old certificate while visible, but after that event ages out the stale durable certificate can reappear. CAS loss caused by concurrent head advancement or a later verification is safe: the operation does not modify the winning head, and event order/current binding prevents the losing result from becoming current.

## Activity

The provider emits mesh entity activity for transitions, verification runs, and goal sets, plus progress updates. These surface in the Fabric dashboard and widget.
