# Agents and rlm reference

`fabric_exec` can spawn one-shot child agents, create persistent event-driven actors, and run recursive queries. For the sandbox model and `tools` discovery, see the parent `fabric-exec` skill; for actor coordination across sessions, see `mesh.md`.

Every method takes a single options object.

## One-shot child agents

- `agents.run(args)` runs to completion and returns `FabricAgentResult` with `{ id, runner, status, text, value?, error?, usage, turns, toolCalls, runnerSessionId? }`.
- `agents.spawn(args)` returns a background `FabricAgentHandle` with an `id`. Then use `agents.wait({ id })`, `agents.status({ id })`, `agents.stop({ id })`.
- `agents.list()` returns all children.
- `agents.cleanup({ id, deleteBranch? })` returns `{ cleaned }` and removes a worktree branch.

`args` is a `FabricAgentRequest`: `{ task, name?, runner?, transport?, model?, thinking?, tools?, timeoutMs?, extensions?, recursive?, worktree?, schema? }`.

- `runner` is `pi` or `claude` and defaults to `subagents.runner` (`pi`).
- `transport` is one of `auto`, `process`, `tmux`, `screen`, `localterm`, `herdr` (default `process`). `auto` tries Herdr when the parent runs inside a Herdr workspace, then LocalTerm, tmux, screen, and process.
- Pi `model` values are `provider/id` keys from `tools.models()`; omitted uses `subagents.model` or inherits the host model. Claude values are `claude/<value>` keys from `agents.models({ runner: "claude" })`; omitted uses `subagents.claude.model` or Claude Code's runtime default. `agents.models()` defaults to the configured runner; Claude discovery is a local CLI control handshake and makes no model inference request.
- `thinking` is the reasoning effort (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`); defaults to `subagents.thinking` (`medium`) and is clamped to the model's supported levels (next highest when unsupported).
- `tools` defaults to `subagents.defaultTools`. Claude maps `read→Read`, `grep→Grep`, `find/ls→Glob`, `bash→Bash`, `edit→Edit`, and `write→Write`; other tool names fail before launch.
- `schema` is a JSON Schema; the worker returns validated structured data in `result.value`.
- `worktree: true` creates a dedicated Git worktree on branch `pi-fabric/<name>-<id>`, retained until `agents.cleanup()`.
- Omit `timeoutMs` normally. It defaults to `subagents.timeoutMs` (60 minutes by default), and per-call values below that configured default are ignored. Set it only to request a longer run.

```ts
const result = await agents.run({
  name: "security-review",
  task: "Review the current diff for concrete security defects. Do not edit files.",
  tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
});
return result;
```

```ts
const handle = await agents.spawn({ task: "Map the persistence layer.", transport: "tmux" });
// independent work here
return await agents.wait({ id: handle.id });
```

## Trajectory handoff

`agents.handoff({ model, task?, when?, ... })` schedules a blocking Pi-to-Pi trajectory handoff at the end of the current outer `fabric_exec`. Inside the guest it returns a deferred marker immediately, so calls after it still run. Once the complete program and all outer result middleware finish, Fabric forks the native assistant `fabric_exec` call plus its exact native `toolResult`, starts the explicit `provider/id` target in the same workspace, and waits before Main can infer again. Do not expect child output inside the same guest program; Main receives it as the final outer tool result.

`when` is guest-only and must be a pure synchronous predicate over immutable successful-call facts. It is deleted before the host validates the request:

```ts
await pi.edit({ path: "src/guard.ts", edits: [{ oldText, newText }] });
await agents.handoff({
  model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
  task: "Continue from this completed Fabric invocation.",
  when: ({ count }) => count("pi.edit") >= 1,
});
await pi.bash({ command: "pnpm test guard" });
return "Frontier invocation complete";
```

Facts include every successful resolved bridge call completed before `agents.handoff()`, from `pi.*`, `extensions.*`, `mcp.*`, external providers, and generic `tools.call()`. Use `count()` for all calls, `count(ref)` for one, or `count([ref, ...])` for a set. Computed calls are recorded under their target ref rather than `fabric.$call`; failed calls do not count. A false or asynchronous predicate starts no child and errors clearly. Omit `when` for unconditional scheduling.

The guest result is `{ scheduled: true, status: "deferred", boundary: "fabric_exec_end" }`; the final outer tool result is `{ handedOff, completed, status, agent, implementation, error? }`. `model` is required and handoff is always Pi-backed. It also accepts `name`, `transport`, `thinking`, `tools`, `timeoutMs`, `extensions`, `recursive`, and `schema`; it deliberately omits `worktree` so implementation remains in the caller's workspace. Do not run handoff in a parallel branch that keeps mutating the same files.

## Automatic prewalk

`/fabric prewalk [task]` arms one automatic handoff when a Fabric invocation contains a successful `pi.edit`, `pi.write`, or `schema.commit`. With a task it submits the task immediately; without one it captures the next user input. The executor is the dedicated `prewalk.model` setting under `/fabric settings`, or an interactive model choice when unset.

Prewalk injects no system-prompt guidance and does not ask Main to call a handoff API. A trigger marks the current outer invocation but does not stop it: all later sequential and parallel nested calls finish normally. The host claims after execution settles, forks the finalized native `fabric_exec` call/result pair, spawns, and waits. The terminating result suppresses Main's automatic post-tool inference. If the captured task settles without a trigger, the arm is cancelled rather than leaking into the next task. Use `/fabric prewalk --status` or `/fabric prewalk --off`. Prewalk requires enabled subagents and full code mode, and is disabled by Schema enforce mode.

Use `/fabric agents` to list children and `/fabric attach <id>` for the attach command. Abort signals propagate to the transport and selected child process. Claude runs use official `claude -p` stream JSON with `dontAsk`, `--tools`, and `--allowedTools`; `extensions: false` adds Claude safe mode. One-shot Claude sessions use `--no-session-persistence`. Claude cannot use `recursive: true`, `fabric_exec`, or direct mesh APIs.

## Steering running agents

Any Fabric-equipped Pi participant (the user-facing Main session, a recursive child, or a persistent Pi actor) can message another known target without discarding its context. Ordinary non-recursive Pi children and Claude children/actors can receive host-routed messages, but cannot initiate `agents.*` calls because they do not run Fabric themselves.

- `agents.peers()` lists other live root Pi sessions sharing the project mesh. The current dashboard owner remains **Main**; other roots are named `Peer <session-prefix>`. Peer records expire after missed heartbeats and can be passed directly to `agents.steer` or `agents.followUp`.
- `agents.main()` returns the root user-facing Pi target as `{ id, name: "Main", kind: "main", status, ... }`. The stable alias `"main"` is also accepted anywhere a steerable target id is expected. Recursive children and Pi actors inherit the exact root Main id, so the alias does not accidentally target their private child session.
- `agents.steer({ id, message, data? })` targets Main, a running one-shot child, or a persistent actor. Main receives a host custom message after the current turn's tools and before the next model call; a one-shot child receives the same between-turn queue semantics; an actor receives a serial mailbox item (equivalent to `tell`). Returns `{ queued, messageId, routed }`.
- `agents.followUp({ id, message, data? })` targets Main or a running one-shot child after its current run settles, or enqueues the same serial actor mailbox. When Main is idle, Pi may start the requested turn immediately.
- `agents.setSteeringMode({ id, mode })` / `agents.setFollowUpMode({ id, mode })` set how queued steer/follow-up messages are delivered to a running one-shot subagent: `"all"` (deliver every queued message after the current turn / when the agent finishes) or `"one-at-a-time"` (one per turn / per completion — the default). Local subagent only.
- `agents.status({ id })` surfaces a local one-shot queue as `pendingMessages: { steering: string[]; followUp: string[] }`. For Main (id or alias), it returns `FabricMainAgentInfo` with boolean `pendingMessages`, because Pi's extension API exposes whether host messages are pending but not their contents.

`routed` is `"main"` for direct delivery to the locally owned user-facing session, `"local"` for a subagent or actor owned by this process, or `"mesh"` for an exact target owned by another Fabric process. Mesh routing is best-effort and requires `mesh.enabled`; the owning process relays to Main, a nested child, or an actor (see `mesh.md`).

```ts
const main = await agents.main();
const peers = await agents.peers();
if (peers[0]) await agents.steer({ id: peers[0].id, message: "Coordinate on the shared migration." });
await agents.followUp({ id: main.id, message: "After the audit, reconcile the worker findings." });
const handle = await agents.spawn({ task: "Audit auth flows.", tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"] });
// Watch progress, then redirect between turns without losing the child's context.
const s = await agents.status({ id: handle.id });
if (s.text.includes("rotating refresh tokens")) {
  await agents.steer({ id: handle.id, message: "Skip refresh-token rotation; focus on session expiry only." });
  await agents.setSteeringMode({ id: handle.id, mode: "all" });
}
return await agents.wait({ id: handle.id });
```

Prefer `agents.steer` over `agents.stop` + `agents.spawn` when the child has useful context you would otherwise discard. Use `agents.stop` only when the child is genuinely off-track and a fresh task is cheaper than a redirect. Steering a finished subagent throws `already finished` — check `agents.status` first. In the dashboard, `s` messages/steers Main, active one-shot agents, actors, and observed mesh agents; `u` queues follow-ups where the target supports a distinct follow-up queue.

## Persistent actors

`agents.create(args)` returns `FabricActorInfo`. An actor has a fixed `runner`, a serial mailbox, and optional subscriptions to parent events or durable mesh topics. It processes messages one at a time, coalesces repeated host events by default, and restores with the project actor registry. Pi actors resume their Fabric-owned Pi session file. Claude actors persist the session ID emitted by `claude -p` and launch later activations with `--resume <id>` while keeping a Fabric-owned stream transcript.

`args` is a `FabricActorRequest`. `delivery` defaults to `mailbox`; `steer`/`followUp` require an explicit `triggerTurn: true | false`, while `mailbox`/`nextTurn` reject `triggerTurn: true`.

- `runner` is fixed at creation. Omitted uses `subagents.runner`. Pi actors are recursively Fabric-equipped; Claude actors retain Claude context and use Claude Code tools, while mailbox/event delivery and coordination remain host-managed (no `fabric_exec` or direct `mesh.*` inside Claude).
- `model` follows the selected runner's key format. Omitted uses that runner's configured/default model. `agents.setModel({ id, model? })` changes or clears the override for the next activation without replacing the actor session; `tell`/`ask` payloads do not change it.
- `thinking` is the reasoning effort forwarded to the actor's runs (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Omitted inherits `subagents.thinking` (default `medium`), clamped to the model's supported levels. Change it later with `agents.setThinking({ id, thinking? })` or `e` from the dashboard actor detail; omitting `thinking` clears the override.
- `events` is a subset of `input`, `turn_end`, `agent_settled`, `tool_error`, `session_compact` (host events to subscribe to).
- `topics` lists durable mesh topics to subscribe to (see `mesh.md`).
- `responseMode` is `text` (every non-empty response becomes an outbox message) or `directive` (validated `{ action, message?, data? }` where `action` is `silent`, `message`, or `stop`; the actor decides whether to intervene).
- `delivery` is `mailbox`, `steer`, `followUp`, or `nextTurn`. An actor cannot escalate it in a response; the owner can replace it with `agents.setDeliveryPolicy({ id, delivery, triggerTurn, scope? })`.
- `triggerTurn` is mandatory for `steer`/`followUp`: `true` starts Main when idle; `false` is passive and the delivered message visibly says it will not start Main. `mailbox`/`nextTurn` never start Main. `coalesce` is on by default.
- `timeoutMs` follows the same floor as one-shot agents: omit it normally and set it only above `subagents.timeoutMs` when an activation needs longer.
- `tools` is the actor's persisted allowlist and defaults to `subagents.defaultTools`. Replace it for future activations with `agents.setTools({ id, tools })`; an empty list disables optional tools. Pi actors retain the host-required `fabric_exec` tool unless created with `extensions: false`. Use `scope: "global"` to update a reusable template instead.
- `extensions` is `true` by default (a Pi actor is recursively Fabric-equipped with the host-required `fabric_exec` tool). Set `extensions: false` to disable Fabric for a Pi actor: the activation runs with `extensions: false` and `recursive: false`, so `fabric_exec` is not injected and the actor cannot call `agents.*` or `mesh.*`; the host still manages its mailbox and delivery (same coordination model as a Claude actor). This does not restrict ordinary tools: also use `tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"]` for a read-only actor or `tools: []` for no tools. Fixed at creation.

```ts
return agents.create({
  name: "auth-supervisor",
  instructions: "Watch the main session until the auth migration is complete and tested. Prefer silence; reply with a directive only for material drift, a blocker, or verified completion.",
  events: ["agent_settled", "tool_error"],
  responseMode: "directive",
  delivery: "steer",
  triggerTurn: true,
  tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
});
```

Mailbox:

- `agents.ask({ id, message, data? })` returns a `FabricActorMessage` (blocking exchange).
- `agents.tell({ id, message, data? })` returns `{ queued, messageId }` (fire and forget).
- `agents.actorStatus({ id })` and `agents.actors()` return actor info.
- `agents.setModel({ id, model? })` and `agents.setThinking({ id, thinking? })` migrate the next activation while preserving the actor's runner session.
- `agents.setTools({ id, tools, scope? })` replaces the persisted tool allowlist for a project actor (default) or global template.
- `agents.setDeliveryPolicy({ id, delivery, triggerTurn, scope? })` replaces the explicit project/global continuation policy without recreating the actor. In the dashboard, press `y` on an actor/template for the same control.
- `agents.messages({ id, limit? })` returns message history.
- `agents.remove({ id })` returns `{ removed }`.
- `agents.log({ id, type?, lines?, runId? })` reads the LLM/agent log for an actor or one-shot run. `type` is `session` (the actor's `session.jsonl` transcript — every user/assistant turn and tool call), `run` (the last retained run's `events.jsonl` event stream), or `all` (both; default `session` for actors). Actors retain their last `MAX_RETAINED_RUNS` runs so logs survive after success. Returns `{ actorId, actorName, sessionFile, logDir, session, run?, retainedRuns }` (actors) or `{ id, runDirectory, logFile, status?, events }` (one-shot runs). Use this to inspect what an "offending" actor actually sent to its model. From the TUI: `/fabric log <id>` previews, `/fabric export-log <id> [path]` writes the raw `session.jsonl` + retained `runs/` to disk.

## Recursive queries

`rlm.query(args)` is a budget-aware `agents.run({ ...args, runner: "pi", recursive: true })` with Fabric enabled in the child. Claude runners are deliberately rejected for recursion. Its usage counts toward `budget.spent()` and the `tokenBudget` guard. Recursion is rejected at `subagents.maxDepth`. Approving the initial recursive call delegates only the `agent` risk capability to recursive children; network, execution, and write approvals are not inherited. Each Fabric process enforces its own concurrency and timeout limits.

```ts
return rlm.query({ task: "Decompose this repository and produce a compact architecture map.", transport: "process" });
```

`council.run({ task, roles, synthesize?, ...agentOptions })` runs several `agents.run` calls concurrently under the subagent semaphore and optionally synthesizes them. The full council pattern is user-invoked; never load `/skill:fabric-council` autonomously.
