# Agents and rlm reference

`fabric_exec` can spawn one-shot child agents, create persistent event-driven actors, and run recursive queries. For the sandbox model and `tools` discovery, see the parent `fabric-exec` skill; for actor coordination across sessions, see `mesh.md`.

Every method takes a single options object.

## One-shot child agents

- `agents.run(args)` runs to completion and returns `FabricAgentResult` with `{ id, status, text, value?, error?, usage, turns, toolCalls }`.
- `agents.spawn(args)` returns a background `FabricAgentHandle` with an `id`. Then use `agents.wait({ id })`, `agents.status({ id })`, `agents.stop({ id })`.
- `agents.list()` returns all children.
- `agents.cleanup({ id, deleteBranch? })` returns `{ cleaned }` and removes a worktree branch.

`args` is a `FabricAgentRequest`: `{ task, name?, transport?, model?, thinking?, tools?, timeoutMs?, extensions?, recursive?, worktree?, schema? }`.

- `transport` is one of `auto`, `process`, `tmux`, `screen`, `localterm` (default `process`). `auto` tries LocalTerm, tmux, screen, then process.
- `tools` defaults to `subagents.defaultTools`. Children inherit the parent model unless `model` is set.
- `schema` is a JSON Schema; the worker returns validated structured data in `result.value`.
- `worktree: true` creates a dedicated Git worktree on branch `pi-fabric/<name>-<id>`, retained until `agents.cleanup()`.

```ts
const result = await agents.run({
  name: "security-review",
  task: "Review the current diff for concrete security defects. Do not edit files.",
  tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
});
return result;
```

```ts
const handle = await agents.spawn({ task: "Map the persistence layer.", transport: "tmux" });
// independent work here
return await agents.wait({ id: handle.id });
```

Use `/fabric agents` to list children and `/fabric attach <id>` for the attach command. Abort signals propagate to the transport and child Pi process.

## Persistent actors

`agents.create(args)` returns `FabricActorInfo`. An actor has its own Pi session, a serial mailbox, and optional subscriptions to parent events or durable mesh topics. It processes messages one at a time, coalesces repeated host events by default, and resumes when the same Pi session reopens in a trusted project.

`args` is a `FabricActorRequest`: `{ name, instructions, events?, topics?, delivery?, responseMode?, triggerTurn?, coalesce?, model?, thinking?, tools?, transport?, timeoutMs? }`.

- `events` is a subset of `input`, `turn_end`, `agent_settled`, `tool_error`, `session_compact` (host events to subscribe to).
- `topics` lists durable mesh topics to subscribe to (see `mesh.md`).
- `responseMode` is `text` (every non-empty response becomes an outbox message) or `directive` (validated `{ action, message?, data? }` where `action` is `silent`, `message`, or `stop`; the actor decides whether to intervene).
- `delivery` is `mailbox`, `steer`, `followUp`, or `nextTurn`; fixed at creation, an actor cannot escalate it.
- `triggerTurn` fires on the first event of a coalesced burst; `coalesce` is on by default.

```ts
return agents.create({
  name: "auth-supervisor",
  instructions: "Watch the main session until the auth migration is complete and tested. Prefer silence; reply with a directive only for material drift, a blocker, or verified completion.",
  events: ["agent_settled", "tool_error"],
  responseMode: "directive",
  delivery: "steer",
  triggerTurn: true,
  tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
});
```

Mailbox:

- `agents.ask({ id, message, data? })` returns a `FabricActorMessage` (blocking exchange).
- `agents.tell({ id, message, data? })` returns `{ queued, messageId }` (fire and forget).
- `agents.actorStatus({ id })` and `agents.actors()` return actor info.
- `agents.messages({ id, limit? })` returns message history.
- `agents.remove({ id })` returns `{ removed }`.

## Recursive queries

`rlm.query(args)` is `agents.run({ ...args, recursive: true })` with Fabric enabled in the child. Recursion is rejected at `subagents.maxDepth`. Approving the initial recursive call delegates only the `agent` risk capability to recursive children; network, execution, and write approvals are not inherited. Each Fabric process enforces its own concurrency and timeout limits.

```ts
return rlm.query({ task: "Decompose this repository and produce a compact architecture map.", transport: "process" });
```

`council.run({ task, roles, synthesize?, ...agentOptions })` runs several `agents.run` calls concurrently under the subagent semaphore and optionally synthesizes them; load `/skill:fabric-council` for the pattern.
