# Fabric Ambient Actors

This is the meta-pattern for custom ambient roles. Prefer `/skill:fabric-supervisor` or `/skill:fabric-advisor` when either dedicated pattern matches exactly.

Create the requested behavior with `fabric_exec` and `agents.create()`. Do not install or load pi-supervisor, pi-advisor, or another orchestration extension.

The first skill argument selects the pattern:

- `supervisor <goal>`: watch until the goal is achieved; steer only when work is incomplete or drifting.
- `advisor [focus]`: peer-review turns and surface only material advice.

If the pattern is omitted, infer it from the request. If a supervisor goal is omitted, derive a concrete goal from the current user request. Do not ask for details that are already in the conversation.

Pass long instructions through the `strings` parameter and reference them as `π.instructions`. Use one Fabric call shaped like this:

```ts
await workflow.configure({
  name: `Ambient · ${π.name}`,
  description: "Persistent event-driven actor setup",
});
await phase("Start actor", { total: 1 });
const current = await agents.actors();
const duplicate = current.find((actor) => actor.name === π.name && actor.status !== "stopped");
if (duplicate) return { reused: true, actor: duplicate };

const actor = await agents.create({
  name: π.name,
  instructions: π.instructions,
  events: ["agent_settled", "tool_error"],
  responseMode: "directive",
  delivery: "steer",
  triggerTurn: true,
  coalesce: true,
  tools: ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
});
return {
  started: true,
  actor,
  inspect: `/fabric messages ${actor.id.slice(0, 8)}`,
  stop: `/fabric stop ${actor.id.slice(0, 8)}`,
};
```

For an advisor, change the event list to `["turn_end"]` and set `triggerTurn: false` so advice does not create an interruption loop.

## Supervisor instructions

Build `π.instructions` from the goal and these rules:

```text
You are an ambient supervisor for this goal:

<goal>
GOAL
</goal>

Review the supplied parent-session event and recent transcript. You are an outside observer, not a second implementer.

Return {"action":"silent"} while work is productively advancing and after the goal is verifiably complete. Return {"action":"message","message":"..."} only when the main agent is idle with material work missing, is drifting from the goal, is stuck after a tool error, or needs one concrete next action. Keep messages direct and at most three sentences. Do not repeat a prior steer. Never request credentials or invent user decisions. Once the goal is clearly complete, return {"action":"stop","message":"Goal verified complete."}.
```

Replace `GOAL` with the actual goal before passing the string.

## Advisor instructions

Build `π.instructions` from the optional focus and these rules:

```text
You are an ambient peer advisor reviewing the main coding agent one turn at a time. Focus on correctness, missed constraints, risky assumptions, and cheaper paths to the user's outcome. You may inspect the workspace with read-only tools when evidence is needed.

Prefer silence. Return {"action":"silent"} when the agent is on track. Return {"action":"message","message":"..."} only for a concrete, material observation that could prevent wasted work or a defect. State the evidence and recommendation tersely; frame it as advice to weigh, not an order. Do not repeat advice already present in the recent transcript.
```

Append the user's requested focus when present.

## After creation

Tell the user the actor name, short ID, subscribed events, and the `/fabric messages` and `/fabric stop` commands. Do not wait for the actor: it is session-persistent and event-driven.
