# Fabric Fusion

Use one `fabric_exec` call for a 1–8 model panel followed by one judge. The judge compares rather than merges responses; return its structured analysis so the caller writes the final answer. Use fusion for model-diverse research or critique, not tactical work or a lookup.

Pass every key: `strings.task`; JSON `strings.panel` as `Array<{ model, label? }>`; and optional `strings.judge`, `strings.tools`, and `strings.thinking` as empty strings when unset. Labels are attribution only. Tools default to `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `bash`; thinking defaults to configured subagent thinking.

```ts
type FusionAnalysis = {
  consensus: string[];
  contradictions: string[];
  partial_coverage: string[];
  unique_insights: string[];
  blind_spots: string[];
};

const task = π.task;
const panel = JSON.parse(π.panel) as Array<{ model: string; label?: string }>;
if (panel.length < 1 || panel.length > 8) {
  throw new Error("Fusion panel (analysis_models) must have 1–8 members.");
}
const toolset = π.tools ? (JSON.parse(π.tools) as string[]) : ["read", "grep", "find", "ls", "bash"];
const thinking = π.thinking ? (π.thinking as FabricThinking) : undefined;

// Resolve models across Pi's registry and Claude Code's runtime catalog.
// Prefix Claude aliases with claude/ (for example claude/haiku) to select the
// official CLI runner unambiguously. Claude Code is optional, so discovery is
// best-effort when the panel contains only Pi models.

const models: RunnerModel[] = (await tools.models()).map((entry) => ({

```

Choose distinct models by intent: strongest available, budget-balanced with a frontier judge, or similar-latency models for faster fan-out. The default panel size is three. Cost is N panel calls plus one judge; set top-level `agentBudget` and `tokenBudget`, while `subagents.budgetUsd` bounds spend.

Panel members and the judge are plain, non-recursive agents, so deliberation is one level. `bash` enables web access through local search/fetch commands and requires execute approval. Concurrency is capped by `subagents.maxConcurrent`; inner calls otherwise inherit provider limits and use `thinking` for reasoning effort.

Use `/skill:fabric-council` instead for same-model, role-diverse review. Use a plain agent when competing model perspectives do not justify the cost.
